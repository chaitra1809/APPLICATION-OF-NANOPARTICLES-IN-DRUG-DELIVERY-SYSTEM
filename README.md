# APPLICATION-OF-NANOPARTICLES-IN-DRUG-DELIVERY-SYSTEM

To develop a more efficient and effective method of delivering  drugs to specific targeted areas(cells or tissues) and reduce the  risk of side effects

# METHODOLOGY ADOPTED  :

1. Targeted drug delivery : Targeting specific cancer cells by 
minimizing the impact on healthy cells using ligands or 
antibodies. 

2. Payload : The drug delivery system should be able to carry a 
sufficient amount of drug to the cancer cells. 

3. Stability of the nanoparticles : The drug delivery system 
should be stable in the body and not breakdown before it 
reaches the target. 

4. Controlled drug release : Release of drug at target site in 
controlled manner using pH-sensitive polymers or temperature
sensitive liposomes.

# RESULTS OBTAINED :

In conclusion the use of nanoparticles in drug delivery systems 
shows great promise for improving the efficiency and safety of 
many drugs.

By selectively targeting specific tissues or cells 
enhancing solubility , providing sustained therapeutic effects, 
and protecting unstable drugs from degradation ,nanoparticles 
can potentially overcome many of the limitations associated 
with traditional drug delivery systems.
